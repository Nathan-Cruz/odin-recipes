            <li>Ground Ginger</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Serve with</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Brioche Bun</li>
            <li>Mayo, Mustard, Honey Sauce</li>
            <li>Sliced Pickles</li>
        </ul>
    <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>First, heat neutral oil in a deep pot or wok till the oil reaches 350 degrees.</li>
            <li>To a bowl, add milk, egg, and pickle juice. Before adding the chicken breast to the pickle brine, use a knife to thin and even out the thick part of the breast.</li>
            <li>Let the chicken breast sit in the brine while you prepare the dredge, or let sit overnight.</li>
            <li>For the breading, add flour, cornstarch, smoked paprika, cayenne powder, garlic powder, ground ginger, onion powder, and salt to a flat baking tray. Add some of the pickle brine liquid to the dredge and mix up this will make some tiny clumps adding additional crunch to the chicken when fried.</li>
            <li>Take the breasts out of the brine and into the breading. Make sure to coat them thoroughly so we get lots of nice crunchy bits when fried.</li>
            <li>Now gently place the chicken into the oil and let fry for 2 minutes before mixing it around. Swirling around the chicken will help prevent cold spots in the oil. Since the breasts are heavy, you will want to flip them to stop the chicken from sitting on the bottom and burning. Take the chicken out of the oil when it reaches an internal temp of 155 degrees.</li>
            <li>To serve, place your honey, mayo, and mustard sauce on a bun along with some pickles. Place the chicken breast on the bun, and you are ready to dig in.</li>
        </ol>
